                My educational journey follows the established Singaporean pathway, 
                characterized by a progression through various esteemed institutions. 
                I embarked on this journey at Northland Primary School (NLPS) and 
                continued my foundational education at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School. 
                Later, I pursued my pre-university studies at Yishun Junior College 
                (now Yishun-Innova Junior College, YIJC), 
                which laid the groundwork for my higher education aspirations.

                The culmination of my educational voyage brought me to Nanyang Technological University (NTU), 
                where I pursued a rigorous and intellectually stimulating Mechanical Engineering program. 
                This period was undeniably challenging, and I encountered my fair share of academic rigors, 
                but the experience was profoundly rewarding.

                I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to complete my educational journey and attain a Bachelor's degree from NTU.

            <p class="ns-text">
                In January 2016, I commenced my national service, initially met with apprehension due to the formidable reputation of military life, 
                where recruits are subject to rigorous training under the guidance of sergeants and officers. 
                Like most Singaporean males, my journey commenced with basic military training (BMT) in Gryphon company. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="ns-text">
                Given that I belonged to the cohort designated as 'obese,' my BMT extended over a span of 19 weeks, 
                primarily dedicated to shedding excess weight. I successfully shed nearly 20 kilograms during this period. 
                Beyond the enhancement of physical fitness, BMT instilled invaluable qualities of mental resilience and preparedness for the defense of Singapore, 
                if the need ever arises. Memorable moments within this phase included live weapon firing and the exhilarating experience of throwing a live grenade, 
                combining trepidation with a sense of thrill.

                Following BMT, I was stationed at Seletar Camp, where my primary responsibilities revolved around the operation of heavy machinery, including bulldozers and excavators.

                One of the proudest moments of my service was the privilege of participating in the National Day Parade (NDP) in 2017. 
                In retrospect, my national service tenure was not only an enriching and transformative experience but also a vital chapter in my personal journey towards maturity."
                As the adage goes, I underwent a transformation from 'Ah Boy to Man'.

                      During my childhood, I embarked on piano lessons up to grade 3 before my interest waned, leading me to cease those lessons. 
                      However, with the passage of time, I've found myself rekindling that passion. 
                      I can still recall the fundamentals, so on occasions when I am free, 
                      I endeavor to learn and master piano pieces of my favorite songs, primarily focusing on Mandarin pop tunes that resonate with me.

                      Occasionally, I find myself gathering with friends for karaoke sessions. 
                      Karaoke serves as a therapeutic escape, allowing me to shed the burdens of the day through song.
                       While I may not be the most accomplished vocalist, every time I hold that microphone, I sing with an unwavering passion. 
                       In those moments, I immerse myself completely, envisioning myself as the original performer in a grand concert, even though the reality may be far from it.

                      While I may not label myself as an avid anime enthusiast, there is one particular anime series that has held a special place in my heart since my childhood ‚Äì Naruto.
                      Even though the series has now transitioned to Boruto, my fondest memories revolve around the original Naruto. 
                      This anime captivated me with its epic battles, especially those between Naruto and the formidable Akatsuki. 
                      It remains an integral part of my childhood, and to this day, I faithfully follow the Boruto series as it continues the legacy of Naruto's adventures.

              I embarked on my professional journey as a software engineer with DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) through the SEED program (Skill Enhancement Education & Development) graduate program.
              You might be wondering why I made the leap into software engineering, especially with a degree in mechanical engineering. 
              After spending four years at NTU, I came to the realization that mechanical engineering wasn't aligning with my interests. 
              It was during my time at university that I discovered my enthusiasm for coding projects and assignments.

              Grateful for having found my true calling, I entered the professional world with uncertainty about my career path. 
              With little prior coding experience, I recognized that enrolling in a technical graduate program was the right step forward. 
              Joining DBS, I was tasked with becoming a Java backend developer. The journey was challenging, requiring dedicated efforts to grasp complex concepts. 
              To bridge my knowledge gap, I immersed myself in online courses, enhancing my understanding of the intricacies involved.
              Over time, the learning curve became more manageable, and I gained proficiency in completing assigned tasks.

              Although it was a demanding endeavor, my lack of initial experience was a hurdle I was determined to overcome. 
              During my one-year tenure at DBS, I accumulated valuable insights and skills on the backend development front. 
              Now, armed with this experience, I have embarked on a new chapter of my career at Avanade.

              As of my current status, my expertise predominantly lies within the realm of backend development, a natural progression given my previous role at DBS, 
              where I specialized in backend responsibilities. 
              However, I am fully committed to enhancing my skill set independently by enrolling in comprehensive online courses from platforms like Udemy. 
              My intention is to broaden my knowledge base in frontend technologies, including Vue, Angular, and React.
